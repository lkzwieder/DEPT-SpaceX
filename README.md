DEPT exercise

to install use:
pnpm i

Run at will using the 'npm run [script]:[flavor]' and the scripts you want to run, for more information check package.json

Using the rest client extension by Huachao Mao (available at least for visual studio code) you can make request to the app using the file http.request located inside src/api, it is there because the idea is to have it very close to the controller that is requesting.

I hope you enjoy reviewing this app at least a half I enjoyed making it.
Best, Gerardo.
